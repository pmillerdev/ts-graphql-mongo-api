# TypeScript and GraphQL API

A GraphQL API I created to improve my back-end skills.

Technologies used: TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL.

## Running Locally

1. Ensure you have a `config.env` declared in the root directory with the `DB_PATH` variable set to your Mongo URI.
2. `yarn` 
3. `yarn dev`
