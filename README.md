# TypeScript and GraphQL API

A GraphQL API written in TypeScript that connects to a MongoDB database using mongoose.

Created for my own learning and professional development.

## Run the API

1. Ensure you have a `config.env` declared in the root directory with the `DB_PATH` variable set to your Mongo URI.
2. `yarn` to install packages
3. `yarn dev` to run the app
